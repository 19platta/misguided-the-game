This is a repository for the game *Misguided*, created by Annabelle Platt and Tigey Jewell-Alibhai.

The game is built on a modular framework. It can be downloaded and played as is or it can be easily modified. Or, the game content can be ignored and a new game can be built on the same framework. For details, see the sections *File Structure* and *Using CSVs as a Framework*.
